puppet-solr
===========

Puppet module for installing solr with a stand alone jetty server.  The server will default to port 8983 and store it's data in /var/lib/solr.  Configuration files can be found at /etc/solr.  

This install has been tested on:

* Ubuntu 12.04
* RHEL 6.4

Using this manifest
-----------

To download a copy of solr into /opt/solr and start a dedicated jetty
server for solr:

1. Check out this repository in your modules directory
2. Add the following to your base manifest (Note that picking the appropriate JDK is left to you):

```pp
package { 'default-jdk': 
           ensure => 'installed',
           before => Class['Solr']
           } 

include solr
```
3. To see your server running visit http://localhost:8983/solr/#
4. For a slightly more full featured example manifest see example.pp


You can also install a tomcat server to host solr.  If so you don't need
to include, just add the module to your modules path and include this in
your manifest.  This example sets up a tomcat server and provides a
zookeeper host to connect in order to run solrCloud.

```pp

package { 'default-jdk': }

class { "solr::tomcat6":
  zookeeper_hosts => "ec2-72-44-55-216.compute-1.amazonaws.com:2181/cld2", 
}
```

For more tomcat configuration options see the tomcat6.pp file in
manifests.



Working with Solr Cloud
-----------------------
Either solr::jetty or solr:tomcat6 can be used to host solrCloud.

```pp
package { 'default-jdk' }

class {'solr::jetty':
  solr_home              => "/var/www/mysite/solr_home"
  zookeeper_hosts        => ["example.com:2181", "anotherserver.org:2181/alternate_root"]
}
```

TODO
----

- Debug problems with tomcat and solr
    - I can get tomcat working, solr ontop of it is having a bad day
- Write some damn testcases damnit
    - just basic things that look for service availablity....
- Finish updating README
